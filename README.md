# The Tech Hut Three
Third Tech-Hut Project

## Description

1. The function first sorts the input integers in ascending order

2. The function then initialises the smallest difference.

3. The Function then iterates over the sorted list and compares the strengths of adjacent pairs.

4. The function finally returns the smallest difference it has found.

### Getting Started

1. Open your python IDE and create a new python file for example `smallest_difference.py`.

2. Copy and paste the code.

3. Save and hit the `run`.

4. The smallest difference will be printed out.
